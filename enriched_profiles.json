We hid it using tesseract OCR and OpenCV. In the end,60 to 70 percent accuracy was achieved on complete masking by applying grayscale and a morphological top-hat function kernel on the scaled image, saving thousands of dollars.\n\nCollateral Tracker: Came up with a web scraping solution using google news and magicBricks APIs to see which companies laid off because of covid 19 and how the loans sanctioned based on the salaries of those fired will be affected.
